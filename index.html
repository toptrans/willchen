<p>“Will has been great to work with on translating content from English to both Japanese and Chinese.” </p>

<p>"Will was very reliable person, this time we had really tight schedule and only could give him 2 days to complete the work.</p>

<p>But he finished in a one day. 
We had plenty of time to use that data to prepare other document, </p>

<p>Definitely recommended."</p>

<p>"Will is very professional and knowledgeable.   His translations were exceptional.  He followed through with every deadline and provide excellent guidance and feedback."</p>

<p>"Chen gave clear explanations and did the translation in record time. Will ask his advice on Chinese related topics."</p>
